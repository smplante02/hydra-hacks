<h3 class="soap2"> soap·box | \ ˈsōp-ˌbäks  \
: an improvised platform used by a self-appointed, spontaneous, or informal orator: something that provides an outlet for delivering opinions </h3>
<h2 class="soap3"> SOAPBOX. is an alternative social platform  curated for young adults to discuss a variety of topics, hold discussions, and establish a mindfulness of varying perspectives. </h2>
<h4 class="soap4">Teens are heavily influenced by the people they grow up with and the communities they grow up in. The teen brain is undeveloped in comparison to the adult brain, which thinks more logically. We are far more impressionable than adults because of our developing brains, which means we are more likely to make decisions based on outside influences than what we truly know. Even with this, there's nothing to suggest that teenagers can't take a breather and think more clearly. Studies show that high school kids, for example, often adopt their parents’ political beliefs instead of developing their own but once they get to college and gain more political information and a place to express and act on their thoughts independently, their political views entirely alter. Blindly making judgments or forming views can have unintended but harmful repercussions. Teenagers must invest in self-education and the formation of their own perspectives to make reasonable judgments now and in the future. While tools exist to empower teens in many sectors, independent thought guidance is an area where more support is needed. We strive to empower teens to get involved in grassroots and national movements through reading personal stories and unbiased news. </h4>
